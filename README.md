# Java Multithreading: Lock Mechanisms

This repository contains code examples demonstrating various lock mechanisms in Java multithreading, including **Read-Write Locks**, **Fair and Unfair Locks**, and **Reentrant Locks**. These concepts are crucial for handling concurrency in multi-threaded applications and ensuring thread safety.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Read-Write Locks
A `ReadWriteLock` allows multiple threads to read a resource concurrently, but only one thread to write at a time. This improves performance when there are more reads than writes.


### 2. Fair and Unfair Locks
- **Fair Locks** ensure that threads acquire locks in the order they request them, preventing starvation. This is useful when all threads need fair access to a resource.
- **Unfair Locks** do not guarantee the order of lock acquisition, which may lead to better performance but can cause thread starvation.

### 3. Reentrant Locks
A `ReentrantLock` is a more flexible alternative to using `synchronized` blocks. A reentrant lock can be acquired multiple times by the same thread, allowing for deeper control over synchronization. It also offers additional features like lock polling, timed lock waits, and interruptible lock waits.
